            Pizza is a delicious and versatile dish that has won the hearts
of people around the world. Originating in Italy, it consists
of a round, flat base of dough topped with sauce, cheese,
and an array of toppings that can range from traditional
pepperoni to gourmet ingredients like arugula and prosciutto. Each
region has its own style, whether itâ€™s the classic Neapolitan,
deep-dish Chicago, or New York-style slices.
